Chapter 2 Java Fundamentals
____________________________
-Package holds java files, they should be all lowercase
-Java classes start with a uppercase letter
-Reserved words are orange

Chapter 3c switch statements
___________________________
-If situation A occurs, <do something>
-Else if situation B occurs, <do something else>
-Else if situation c occurs, <do something else>

~Chapter 3c Nested if statements~
_________________________________
-If a certain situation occurs, check for the next situation

~Chapter 3b if- else statement
_____________________________
<do something>
otherwise,
<do something else>
~Chapter 3f relational and logical operators~
_____________________________________________
Relational operators:
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equal to
!= not equal to
Logical operators:
&& And both conditions must be true
|| or at least one condition must be true

~Chapter 4a while loop repetition structures
___________________________________________
//Initialize known variables
//Get input for known variables
//Validate input
//Calculate total

~Chapter 6a Classes and Objects~
________________________________
-Everything in java is associated with classes and objects, along with it's attributes and methods
-An object is created from a class. We have already created the class named main, so now we can use this to create objects
-To create an object of main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keywork

~Chapter 6d Overloading within a class
_____________________________________
	Overloaded constructors
public class Mushroom{
public Mushroom(int size){}
public Mushroom(){}
public Mushroom(boolean is perfect){}
-Overloaded constructors means you have more than one constructor/parameter in your class

~Chapter 7b Searching Arrays~
_____________________________
-Searches every element in the array until it finds the value it's looking for or until it arrives at the end of the array
-Inefficient for more than 7,000 elements
Binary search:
-Elements would need to be in ascending order from least to greatest
-Quicker approach than sequential
(Arrays.binarySearch)

~Chapter 9 Inheritance~
_______________________
-Inheriting attributes and methods from one class to another
-To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword
-The car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the vehicle class (superclass)

~Chapter 10 Polymorphism~
________________________
-Means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance

~What I learned from the videos overall~
I loved the videos and they were very helpful, everything I wrote down was a refresher/something I learned that was new.
